It's a simple calculator that takes marks of 5 subjects and then presents total and grade according to some criteria of grading.

Also if you try to enter marks more than 100 in input marks section than you will be alerted to enter marks in range of 100.

if(ave>=80 && ave <=100)
   "Your grade is A"
                
else if(ave>=75 && ave <80){
 "Your grade is B"
                                                       // Here ave represents the average of marks.
else if(ave>=70 && ave <75)
"Your grade is B"
                
else if(ave>=65 && ave <70)
"Your grade is B"
                
else if(ave>=60 && ave <65)
"Your grade is B"
                
else if(ave>=50 && ave <60)
"Your grade is B"
                
else 
"You FAILED!!!!"
